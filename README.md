👉🏻 [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)

## 📦 `go_by_example` Package

This is a collection of Go scripts each corresponding to a topic, most of which is copied from the **Go by Example** website, with a small modification from me.

## 🚀 Running the scripts

To run any of the scripts, uncomment the corresponding function call in the `main.go`, and run like this:

```bash
go run .
```
