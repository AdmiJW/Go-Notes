👉🏻 [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)

This is a collection of Go scripts each corresponding to a topic, most of which is copied from the **Go by Example** website, with a small modification from me.

To run any of the scripts, change the function call in the `main.go`, and run like this:

```bash
go run ./main
```
