## üì¶ `go_by_example` Package

This is a collection of Go scripts each corresponding to a topic, most of which is copied from the **Go by Example** website, with a small modification from me.

## üì¶ `validator` Package

This package contains example scripts that demonstrate how to use the `validator` package by `go-playground`. `validator` implements value validations for structs
and individual fields based on tags. The scripts are copied from the examples from the validator's GitHub repository, with a small modification from me.

## üì¶ `records_api` Package

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Still Work in Progress**

Based on the **Tutorial: Developing a RESTful API with Go and Gin**, this is a simple RESTful API that uses the Gin framework to provide access to store selling vintage recordings on vinyl. Extra features are added to the original tutorial, such as validation, using a database, and more.

## üöÄ Running the scripts

To run any of the scripts, uncomment the corresponding function call in the `main.go`, and run like this:

```bash
go run .
```
